## üåê Bilingual Support Options

### Option A: Payload Localization (Recommended)
Enable localization in `payload.config.ts`:
```typescript
localization: {
  locales: ['en', 'ms'],
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  fallback: true,
}
```

### Option B: Duplicate Pages
Create two separate pages:
- `/digitalcontent` (English)
- `/kandungandigi` (Malay)

---

## üé® Styling Notes

Current styling is basic inline CSS. To improve:

1. **Create CSS Module** (`digitalcontent.module.css`)
2. **Use Tailwind** (you have it configured)
3. **Extract components** (e.g., `Card.tsx`, `Section.tsx`)
4. **Add animations** (e.g., fade-in on scroll)

## üîó Route Access

Once created, your page will be accessible at:
- `http://localhost:3000/digitalcontent`
