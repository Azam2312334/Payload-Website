# Improved Block Organization - Separate Fields for Each Page Type

## ✅ What Changed:

### Problem:
- ALL blocks were available for ALL custom page types
- You could add "Hero" (About block) to Digital Content page
- Confusing and error-prone

### Solution:
- **Separate block fields** for each page type
- Each page type only sees its own blocks
- Much cleaner admin experience

---

## 📋 New Structure:

### Pages Collection Fields:

```typescript
1. Standard Pages (pageType: 'standard')
   └── content: richText

2. About Page (pageType: 'about')
   └── aboutBlocks: blocks
       ├── Hero
       ├── Content Section
       └── Features Grid

3. Digital Content Page (pageType: 'digitalContent')
   └── digitalContentBlocks: blocks
       ├── Digital Content Hero
       ├── Focus Area
       ├── Global Champion
       ├── National Impact
       ├── Industry Size
       ├── Our Highlights
       ├── Programmes Initiatives
       ├── Our Publications
       ├── Get In Touch
       └── FAQ
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### When Creating/Editing a Page:

#### 1. Select Page Type: "Standard Page"
```
Shows:
  ✅ Content (richText editor)

Hides:
  ❌ About Blocks
  ❌ Digital Content Blocks
```

#### 2. Select Page Type: "About"
```
Shows:
  ✅ About Blocks (Hero, Content Section, Features Grid)

Hides:
  ❌ Content
  ❌ Digital Content Blocks
```

#### 3. Select Page Type: "Digital Content"
```
Shows:
  ✅ Digital Content Blocks (10 blocks specific to digital content)

Hides:
  ❌ Content
  ❌ About Blocks
```

## 🔧 Files Updated:

### 1. **`src/collections/Pages.ts`**
Changed from:
```typescript
{
  name: 'blocks',
  type: 'blocks',
  blocks: [...AboutBlocks, ...DigitalContentBlocks], // All blocks together
}
```

To:
```typescript
{
  name: 'aboutBlocks',
  type: 'blocks',
  admin: { condition: (data) => data.pageType === 'about' },
  blocks: AboutBlocks,
},
{
  name: 'digitalContentBlocks',
  type: 'blocks',
  admin: { condition: (data) => data.pageType === 'digitalContent' },
  blocks: DigitalContentBlocks,
},
```

### 2. **`src/app/(frontend)/about/page.tsx`**
Changed from:
```typescript
{page.blocks?.map((block: any, index: number) => {
```

To:
```typescript
{page.aboutBlocks?.map((block: any, index: number) => {
```

### 3. **`src/app/(frontend)/digitalcontent/page.tsx`**
Changed from:
```typescript
{page.blocks?.map((block: any, index: number) => {
```

To:
```typescript
{page.digitalContentBlocks?.map((block: any, index: number) => {
```

## ⚠️ Important: Data Migration Needed!

### For Existing Pages:

Your existing Digital Content page has blocks in the old `blocks` field. You need to:

1. Go to admin: `http://localhost:3001/admin/collections/pages/4`
2. **Copy** the block content
3. **Delete** the old page OR
4. **Clear** the blocks field
5. Add blocks to the NEW `digitalContentBlocks` field
6. Save

---

## 🎨 Admin Panel Experience:

### Before:
```
Page Type: Digital Content
└── Blocks: [Add Block ▼]
    ├── [About] Hero          ← Confusing! Wrong page type
    ├── [About] Content Section
    ├── [About] Features Grid
    ├── [Digital Content] Digital Content Hero
    ├── [Digital Content] Focus Area
    └── ... (all mixed together)
```

### After:
```
Page Type: Digital Content
└── Digital Content Blocks: [Add Block ▼]
    ├── Digital Content Hero  ← Only relevant blocks!
    ├── Focus Area
    ├── Global Champion
    └── ... (only Digital Content blocks)
```

---

## ✅ Benefits:

1. **No Confusion** - Only see relevant blocks for your page type
2. **Prevents Errors** - Can't accidentally add wrong block type
3. **Better Organization** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Type Safety** - Each field has specific block types
5. **Cleaner Admin** - Less clutter in block dropdown

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will regenerate TypeScript types.

### 2. Recreate Your Digital Content Page
1. Go to admin panel
2. Create new Digital Content page
3. Select Page Type: "Digital Content"
4. Now you'll see **only** "Digital Content Blocks" field
5. Add your blocks (Digital Content Hero, etc.)
6. Save

### 3. Test
- Navigate to `/digitalcontent`
- Should now display correctly!

## 📊 Summary:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Block Fields | 1 shared `blocks` field | 3 separate fields |
| About Page | `page.blocks` | `page.aboutBlocks` |
| Digital Content | `page.blocks` | `page.digitalContentBlocks` |
| Admin UX | All blocks mixed | Only relevant blocks |
| Error Prone | ⚠️ Yes | ✅ No |

**Much better architecture now!** 🎉

Each page type has its own dedicated block field, making it impossible to mix blocks from different page types!
